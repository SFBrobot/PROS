# PROS Stuff
This is a repository for anything we use PROS for, so it's primarily for advanced programmers. PROS is a C implementation for Cortex, so it's the same syntax used in C, (very similar to RobotC), and the commands are the same. It's also open-source, so you don't need to fork out $80 for a personal copy. It is, however, a pain to find sample code for, but here are the commands:

and the documentation:

Enter at your own peril, and have fun with PROS!
